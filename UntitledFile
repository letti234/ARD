//Introduction to Earth Engine

//Google Earth Engine is an incredible tool. We can use it to perform geocomputations across large spatial scales using the Google Cloud. And we can
//directly call from an enormous repository of spatial data.

//This tutorial will provide an introduction to working with images/image collections (rasters) and features/feature collections (polygons).

//Note that GEE uses a Javascript API. The coding language is a mix of Javascript and Earth Engine specific tools. It's not the easiest coding language
//to work in because user support is limited. But for the simple task of generating geocomputations and exporting, GEE is a great and not-too-difficult
//tool


//Working with features

  //Call on a shapefile of Canada - we can directly call FAO GAUL's ADM2 data in GEE
  
  var world = ee.FeatureCollection("FAO/GAUL/2015/level2");
  
  //print the first 10 entries
  
  print("FAU GAUL", world.limit(10))
  
  //Subset to Canada using ADM0_NAME
  
  var Canada = world.filter(ee.Filter.eq("ADM0_NAME", "Canada"));
  
  //Map Canada - the 0 at the end is a Boolean operator indicating that we don't automatically put the polygons on the map.
  //Change the operator to 1 and the polygons show up automatically.
  Map.addLayer(Canada, {}, "Canada", 0)
  
  //We can use these different polygons to calculate zonal statistics. Note that we could also call on provinces ("/level1")
  //or even lower administrative units (but we need to get the postal code data first!)
